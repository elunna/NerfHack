.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dlb
is a file archiving tool in the spirit (and tradition) of
.IR tar (1)
for
.IR nethack (6)
version 3.1 and higher.
It is used to maintain the
archive files from which the game reads special level files and other
read-only information.
Note that like
.IR tar ,
the letters specifying the operation and options
are expressed as a continuous string.
Unlike
.IR tar ,
.I dlb
is configured with a default set of file names to process.

.IP \(bu 2n
Not a good
.I tar
emulation;
.B -
does not mean stdin or stdout.
.IP \(bu
Should include an optional compression facility.
.IP \(bu
Not all read-only files for NetHack can be read out of an archive;
examining the source is the only way to know which files can be.
