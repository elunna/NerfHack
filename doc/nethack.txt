DESCRIPTION
       NetHack is a display oriented Dungeons & Dragons(tm) - like game.   The
       standard tty display and command structure resemble rogue.

       Other, more graphical display options exist for most platforms.

       To  get started you really only need to know two commands.  The command
       ?  will give you a list of the available commands  (as  well  as  other
       information)  and the command / will identify the things you see on the
       screen.

       To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to  beat  other  people's
       high  scores)  you  must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere
       below the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out.  Few people achieve
       this;  most never do.  Those who have done so go down in history as he-
       roes among heroes -- and then they find ways of making  the  game  even
       harder.   See  the Guidebook section on Conduct if this game has gotten
       too easy for you.

       When the game ends, whether by your dying, quitting, or  escaping  from
       the  caves, NetHack will give you (a fragment of) the list of top scor-
       ers.  The scoring is based on many aspects  of  your  behavior,  but  a
       rough estimate is obtained by taking the amount of gold you've found in
       the cave plus four times your (real) experience.  Precious  stones  may
       be  worth  a  lot  of  gold  when  brought to the exit.  There is a 10%
       penalty for getting yourself killed.

       The environment variable NETHACKOPTIONS can be used to initialize  many
       run-time  options.   The  ?  command  provides  a  description of these
       options and syntax.  (The -dec and -ibm command line options are  mutu-
       ally  exclusive  and  are equivalent to the decgraphics and ibmgraphics
       run-time options described there, and are provided  purely  for  conve-
       nience on systems supporting multiple types of terminals.)

       Because  the option list can be very long, options may also be included
       in a configuration file.  The default is located in your home directory
       and  named  .nerfhackrc  on  UNIX systems (including descendants such as
       linux, NetBSD, and macOS).  On Windows, the name is also .nerfhackrc but
       the  location  can vary (see --showpaths below).  On other systems, the
       default may be different, possibly nerfhack.cnf.  On MS-DOS, the name is
       defaults.nh in NetHack's directory (folder), while on VMS|OpenVMS it is
       nerfhack.ini in your home directory.  The default configuration file may
       be  overridden  via  the  --nerfhackrc:rc-file command line option or by
       setting NETHACKOPTIONS in your environment to a string consisting of an
       @ character followed by the path and filename.

       The  -u  playername option supplies the answer to the question "Who are
       you?".  It overrides any name from the options or  configuration  file,
       USER,  LOGNAME,  or getlogin(), which will otherwise be tried in order.
       If none of these provides a useful name, the player will be  asked  for
       one.  Player names (in conjunction with uids) are used to identify save
       files, so you can have several saved games under different names.  Con-
       versely,  you  must  use the appropriate player name to restore a saved
       game.

       A playername suffix can be used to specify the profession, race, align-
       ment and/or gender of the character.  The full syntax of the playername
       that includes a suffix is "name-ppp-rrr-aaa-ggg".  "ppp" are  at  least
       the  first  three letters of the profession (this can also be specified
       using a separate -p profession option).  "rrr" are at least  the  first
       three letters of the character's race (this can also be specified using
       a separate -r race option).  "aaa" are at least the first three letters
       of  the  character's  alignment, and "ggg" are at least the first three
       letters of the character's gender.  Any of the parts of the suffix  may
       be left out.

       -p  profession  can be used to determine the character profession, also
       known as the role.  You can specify either the male or female name  for
       the  character  role,  or  the first three characters of the role as an
       abbreviation.

       Likewise, -r race can be used to explicitly request that a race be cho-
       sen.

       The -A|-Arc | -B|-Bar | -C|-Cav | -H|-Hea | -K|-Kni | -M|-Mon | -P|-Pri
       | -R|-Rog | -Ran | -S|-Sam | -T|-Tou | -V|-Val |  -W|-Wiz  options  for
       role  selection are maintained for compatibility with older versions of
       the program.  They are mutually exclusive and  the  single-letter  form
       must  be  uppercase.   Ranger has no single-letter choice because -R is
       already used for the Rogue role.

       -@  tells  nethack  to  choose  any  omitted  characteristics  (profes-
       sion/role, race, gender, alignment) randomly without prompting.  Other-
       wise, leaving out any of these characteristics will result in you being
       prompted during game startup for the information.

       The -n option suppresses printing of any news from the game administra-
       tor.

       The -X option will start the game in a  special  non-scoring  discovery
       mode  (also  known  as  explore mode).  -D will start the game in debug
       mode (also known as wizard mode) after changing the character  name  to
       "wizard",  if  the  player is allowed.  Otherwise it will switch to -X.
       Control of who is allowed to use debug mode is done via the  "WIZARDS="
       line in nethack's sysconf file.

       The  -d  or  --directory option, which must be the first argument if it
       appears, supplies a directory which is to serve as the playground.   It
       overrides  the  value from NETHACKDIR, HACKDIR, or the directory speci-
       fied  by   the   game   administrator   during   compilation   (usually
       /usr/games/lib/nethackdir).   This option is usually only useful to the
       game administrator.  The  playground  must  contain  several  auxiliary
       files  such  as help files, the list of top scorers, and a subdirectory
       save where games are saved.

       The -w or --windowtype interface option can be used  to  specify  which
       interface  to  use  if the program has been built with support for more
       than one.  Specifying a value on the command line overrides  any  value
       specified  in the run-time configuration file.  NetHack's #version com-
       mand shows available interfaces.

       The --nerfhackrc:RC-file option will use RC-file instead of the  default
       run-time   configuration   file   (typically   ~/.nerfhackrc)   and  the
       --no-nerfhackrc option can be used to skip  any  run-time  configuration
       file.


       Some options provide feedback and then exit rather than play the game:

       The  -s or --scores option alone will print out the list of your scores
       on the current version.  An immediately following  -v  reports  on  all
       versions present in the score file.  `-s|-s -v' may also be followed by
       arguments -p profession and -r race to print the scores  of  particular
       roles  and  races  only.   Either  can  be  specified multiple times to
       include more than one role or more than one race.  When both are speci-
       fied,  score  entries which match either the role or the race (or both)
       are printed rather than just entries which match both.  `-s|-s -v'  may
       be  followed  by  one  or  more player names to print the scores of the
       players mentioned, by 'all' to print out all scores, or by a number  to
       print  that many top scores.  Combining names with role or race or both
       will report entries which match any of those rather than just the  ones
       which match all.

       --version  can be used to cause NetHack to show the version information
       it was compiled with, then exit.  That will include the git commit hash
       if  the  information was available when the game was compiled.  On some
       platforms, such as Windows and macOS, a variation --version:copy can be
       used to cause NetHack to show the version information, then exit, while
       also leaving a copy of the version information in the paste  buffer  or
       clipboard for potential insertion into things like bug reports.

       --showpaths  can be used to cause NetHack to show where it is expecting
       to find various files.  Among other things it shows  the  path  to  and
       name  for  the  player's run-time configuration file, a text file which
       can be editted to customize aspects of how the game operates.

       --usage or --help will display information similar to this manual page,
       then exit.  Use `nethack --usage | more' to read it a page at a time.

AUTHORS
       Jay  Fenlason  (+  Kenny  Woodland, Mike Thome and Jon Payne) wrote the
       original hack, very much like rogue (but full of bugs).

       Andries Brouwer continuously deformed their sources  into  an  entirely
       different game.

       Mike Stephenson has continued the perversion of sources, adding various
       warped character classes and sadistic  traps  with  the  help  of  many
       strange  people who reside in that place between the worlds, the Usenet
       Zone.  A number of these miscreants are immortalized in the  historical
       roll of dishonor and various other places.

       The  resulting mess is now called NetHack, to denote its development by
       the Usenet.  Andries Brouwer has made this request for the distinction,
       as he may eventually release a new version of his own.

FILES
       Run-time  configuration options were discussed above and use a platform
       specific name for a file in a platform specific  location.   For  Unix,
       the name is '.nerfhackrc' in the user's home directory.

       All   other   files   are   in   the   playground  directory,  normally
       /usr/games/lib/nethackdir.  If DLB was defined during the compile,  the
       data  files  and  special levels will be inside a larger file, normally
       nhdat, instead of being separate files.
