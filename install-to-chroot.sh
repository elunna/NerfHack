# 🔴 NEVER `cp` over a file in a live chroot. `cp` opens the destination
# O_TRUNC, so an existing file is briefly zero-length WHILE games hold it open:
#   - every running nethack holds nh500.0-hdf/nhdat open for the whole session
#     and reads level/lua data from it, so a truncating overwrite hands a live
#     game a short read mid-play;
#   - for anything mmap'd, a demand fault past the shortened EOF is SIGBUS, and
#     nethack traps only SIGHUP and SIGXCPU -- so that is a LOST CHARACTER, not
#     a caught error.
#
# Stage alongside the target, then rename(2). A running process keeps its old
# inode as `(deleted)` and finishes on it; the next exec picks up the new file.
# Staging in the DESTINATION DIRECTORY is load-bearing -- rename is only atomic
# within a single filesystem, and a cross-device `mv` silently degrades to
# copy+unlink, which reintroduces exactly the window this exists to close.
# Mode and owner are set on the staged copy, so the file is never visible at
# the target path with the wrong permissions.
