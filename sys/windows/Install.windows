| Build and package NetHack for Windows yourself                        |
\----------------------------------------------------------- -----------/

We provide documentation for the follow three different approaches
and tool suites that may be used to compile and package
NetHack for Windows:

    1. With the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
       The steps are documented in sys/windows/build-vs.txt.

    2. At the Windows command line, using Visual Studio's nmake.exe.
       The steps are documented in sys/windows/build-nmake.txt.

    3. At the bash shell using MSYS2.
       The steps are documented in sys/windows/build-msys2.txt.

\--------------------------------------------------------------/

Executing NetHack on your machine

    Unzip the files to a folder on your machine, from
    Windows explorer right-click | Extract all...
    or by using tar:
        Windows command prompt:
           tar -xf nethack-370-win-x64.zip

        MSYS2 bash shell:
           /c/Windows/System32/tar -xf nethack-370-win-x64.zip

    Run NetHack.exe or NetHackW.exe from the folder where you unzipped.

    Your personal config file, if it doesn't exist, will be created
    from a template file the first time you fire up NetHack.

    If you want to edit your actual personal config file you can
    reference the file as follows:

        From Windows cmd command prompt:
        %USERPROFILE%\nethack\.nethackrc

        From Windows powershell:
        $env:USERPROFILE\nethack\.nethackrc

        From MSYS2 bash shell:
        $USERPROFILE/nethack/.nethackrc


        From Windows powershell:
        $env:USERPROFILE\nethack\.nethackrc

        From MSYS2 bash shell:
        $USERPROFILE/nethack/.nethackrc


    If you want to see where NerfHack expects to find the other files it
    utilizes, you can issue the following command:
        nerfhack --showpaths



Play NetHack.
