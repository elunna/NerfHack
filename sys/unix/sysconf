# Sample sysconf file.
# The sysconf file is only used if NetHack is compiled with SYSCF defined.
# It can be used to augment or override certain settings compiled into the
# program.
#
# This file can also be used to set local system defaults for run-time
# options, using the same syntax as an individual user's ./nerfhackrc file.

# Which users can use debug mode (aka wizard mode; accessed via '-D' command
# line flag or OPTIONS=playmode:debug in the runtime options config file).
# A value of * allows anyone to enter debugging mode.

WIZARDS=*
#WIZARDS=root games

# Which users can use explore mode (aka discover mode; accessed via '-X'
# command line flag or OPTIONS=playmode:explore in runtime options file or
# via '#exploremode' command during normal play).  Same syntax as WIZARDS.
EXPLORERS=*

# Users allowed to use the '!' (shell escape) and '^Z' (suspend process)
# commands to temporarily leave the game and enter a shell process.
# (To resume play, use the shell command 'exit' (for most shells) to
# return from '!' or the shell command 'fg' to return from '^Z'.
# For the typical multi-user system where players have access to a shell
# prompt when logged in and run the game from their own username, a value
# of 'SHELLERS=*' is appropriate.  However, some inexperienced players
# occasionally get stuck outside the game by accidentally typing '!' or
# '^Z' during play and not knowing how to go back.)
# Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS and EXPLORERS options above.
#SHELLERS=

# If the user name is found in this list, prompt for username instead.
# Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS option above.
# A public server should probably disable this.
# ["ec2-user" is the default user name on Amazon Linux]
#GENERICUSERS=play player game games nethack nethacker ec2-user

# Use the player name for matching WIZARDS, EXPLORERS and SHELLERS,
# instead of the user's login name.
#CHECK_PLNAME=1

# Limit the number of simultaneous games (see also nerfhack.sh).
# Valid values are 0-25.
# Commenting this out or setting the value to 0 constructs lock files
# with UID and playername, so each user may have one game at a time,
# but number of different players is not limited.
# Setting this to any other value constructs the lock files with
# letter and "lock" (eg. alock, block, ...)
MAXPLAYERS=0

# If not null, added to string "To get local support, " in the support
# information help.
SUPPORT=Contact hackemslashem on Libera irc channel #hardfought

# If not null, displayed at the end of a panic-save sequence.
#RECOVER=Run the recover program.

# Uncomment the next line to disable the SEDUCE option, causing succubi and
# incubi to use nymphs' charm behavior rather than their own seduce behavior.
#SEDUCE=0

# Uncomment the next line to enable some accessibility features such
# as S_hero_override and S_pet_override symbols for screen readers
# in the user config file.

# Uncomment to disable savefile UID checking.

# CAUTION: changing these after people have started playing games can
#  lead to lost high scores!
# Maximum entries for one person.

# Help menu control; 0 - include "command line usage" entry in help menu;
# 1 - suppress it from the menu.  Does not affect 'nerfhack --usage' when
# player has access to the command line.
#HIDEUSAGE=0

# Use "Live logging" for important events (achievements, wishes, etc)
# Only available if NerfHack was compiled with LIVELOG.
# Only really meaningful for public servers.

# Number of bones file pools.
# The pool you belong to is determined at game start. You will

# Try to get more info in case of a program bug or crash.  Only used

# By default PANICTRACE is enabled if (NH_DEVEL_STATUS != NH_STATUS_RELEASED),
# otherwise disabled.
# Using GDB can get more information and works on more systems but requires
# 'gdb' be available; using LIBC only works if NetHack is linked with a
# libc that supports the backtrace(3) API.  Both require certain compilation
# options.  See src/end.c and sys/unix/hints/* for more information.

# 'portable_device_paths' is only supported for Windows.  Starting with
# 3.6.3, nethack on Windows treats the folder containing nerfhack.exe and
# nerfhackW.exe as read-only and puts data files which are generated or
# modified during play or by the user in assorted folders derived from
# user name.  3.6.4 added PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS to allow reverting to
# the old behavior of having the run-time configuration file and other
# data in the same directory as the executable so that the whole thing
# can be moved from one machine to another (flash drive or perhaps cloud)
# without updating folder paths.
#PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS=0

# Ordinary run-time options can be set here to override the builtin-in
# default values.  Unlike all the SYSCF values above, individual users
# can override the overridden options set here by choosing their own
# option settings via NERFHACKOPTIONS in their environment or via
# ~/.nerfhackrc run-time configuration file.
