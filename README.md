# Hack'EM

Welcome, traveler, to HACKEM MUCHE!  

HACKEM is the followup to Hack'EM, which was a modernized SLASH'EM based on EvilHack - which was based on NetHack 3.6.2.

HACKEM starts fresh from NetHack 3.7.0 WIP aims to accomplish a couple concise goals:

1) Increase the difficulty
2) Do more with less
3) Increase quality-of-life
4) Stay current with Vanilla NetHack

After playing an enjoyable quick game in the 2023 November NetHack tournament, he found it refreshing to just play through without worrying about the loads of extra features added in Hack'EM - notably object materials and object properties. He decided that the next iteration would be composed of a much more trimmed down feature set, reducing the cognitive load on both the player to learn the new variant, and the dev to maintain it.

## Goal #1: Increase the difficulty

Lots of inspiration and changes were pulled from other forks. To make the game more difficult these methods were followed:

* Reduce resources (wishes, magic markers, luck, alchemy, altar gifts, etc)
* Reduce over-bloated AC in the mid-and-late game
* Increase requirements for skill training
* Trim exploitative strategies
* Differentiate roles more deeply

## Goal #2: Do more with less

Instead of importing loads and loads of content and becoming a "kitchen-sink variant", we are taking a much more restrained approach, only importing content that has demonstrable impact on gameplay and is easy to learn.

As an example, in Hack'EM there were about double the monsters that Vanilla had, but many of them were very similar or almost copies of monsters Vanilla already had (many of the SLASH'EM monsters were like this). As a result, the monsters ported in to HACKEM is only about 30.

Features that are *not* being ported include:
- object materials
- object properties
- dtsund dragon scales
- forges
- magic chests
- puddles
- sewage
- tinker/upgrading
- player monsters
- firearms/bombs
- gehennom hellfire
- alignment abuse record/quest leader battles
- alignment quests/alignment keys
- altar minions
- sonic damage
- techniques
- shopkeeper services

These features were interesting, but also required lots of maintenance and proved very difficult to balance. Until Vanilla successfully adopts these, we are putting them on indefinite hold.

Features that are still TBD:
- partial resistances
- partial reflection
- EvilHack style zombies
- The fear mechanic

## Goal #3: Increase quality-of-life
## Goal #4: Stay current with Vanilla NetHack

Bits and pieces from other variants has been added as well: SpliceHack, UnNetHack, SLASH'EM, SlashTHEM, xNetHack, FIQHack, GnollHack, SporkHack, GruntHack.
